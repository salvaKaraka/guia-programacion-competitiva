## What is competitive programming

Competitive programming is solving algorithmic problems under time pressure. You get a problem, need to think of the solution, code it up, and make it pass all test cases.

It's like a math exam, but with code. And it's addictive.

## Why it's worth it

It's not just about winning medals (though that's nice). Competitive programming teaches you:

- **Think fast** under pressure
- **Solve problems** systematically  
- **Write clean code** that works on the first try
- **Optimize algorithms** for edge cases
- **Debug quickly** when something breaks

All of this helps with technical interviews, personal projects, and real work.

## Setting up your environment

### Editor and compiler

You need something fast and reliable. Most popular options:

**C++** (recommended for beginners):
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
g++ -o solution solution.cpp -std=c++17 -O2

# On Windows with MinGW
g++ -o solution.exe solution.cpp -std=c++17 -O2
```

**Python** (slower, but easier):
```bash
python solution.py
```

**Java** (verbose, but powerful):
```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

### Basic C++ template

This template will save you time on every problem:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    // Your code here
    
    return 0;
}
```

**What each line does:**
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes all libraries (only works with GCC)
- `using namespace std;`: You don't have to write `std::` all the time
- `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);`: Makes `cin` and `cout` faster
- `cin.tie(NULL);`: Additional optimization for input/output

## Your first problem

Let's start with something simple. On most platforms, the first problem is reading two numbers and adding them.

**Problem:**
```
Given two integers A and B, print A + B.

Input:
3 5

Output:
8
```

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << a + b << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Simple, right? But notice the details:
- We read with `cin`, not `scanf`
- We print with `cout`, not `printf`
- We use `endl` for newline (though `\n` is faster)

## How to study

### 1. Understand the problem
Before coding, make sure you understand what they're asking. Read the examples, think about edge cases.

### 2. Think of the solution
Don't jump straight to coding. Think about the algorithm first. Write it on paper if needed.

### 3. Implement
Code cleanly. Use clear variable names, comment important parts.

### 4. Test
Test your code with the problem examples. Think about cases that might fail.

### 5. Submit and learn
If it passes, great. If not, read the error, think about what could be wrong, fix it.

## Common mistakes

**Integer overflow**: Use `long long` when numbers are large
```cpp
long long a = 1000000000;
long long b = 1000000000;
cout << a * b << endl;  // With int, this gives wrong result
```

**Array bounds**: Don't exceed array size
```cpp
int arr[100];
// arr[100] is invalid, last valid index is 99
```

**Wrong output format**: Read carefully what output format they expect
```cpp
// If they want "Case 1: 42", don't just print "42"
cout << "Case " << i << ": " << result << endl;
```

## Next steps

Now that you have the basics set up:

1. **Sign up** on Codeforces and AtCoder
2. **Solve** some problems of difficulty 800-900 on Codeforces
3. **Participate** in a contest to see what it feels like
4. **Practice** basic problems until you're comfortable with the syntax

The key is consistent practice. Better 30 minutes a day than 5 hours once a week.

Good luck!
