## Everything you need to know to compete

This guide covers the most important algorithms in competitive programming. Each topic includes clear explanations, ready-to-use code, and problems to practice.

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Basic Techniques" icon="rocket">
		**Start here if you're new**
		
		- Time and space complexity
		- Sorting and binary search
		- Basic data structures
		- Greedy algorithms
		- Dynamic programming
		
		Everything with step-by-step examples and commented code.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Graph Algorithms" icon="puzzle">
		**Most used in competitions**
		
		- DFS and BFS traversals
		- Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)
		- Minimum spanning trees
		- Maximum flows and cuts
		
		With optimized implementations and real use cases.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Math and Combinatorics" icon="pencil">
		**For problems that seem impossible**
		
		- Basic number theory
		- Modular arithmetic
		- Combinatorics and probability
		- String algorithms
		
		Not too much theory, straight to the practical stuff.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why this guide works

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Code that compiles" icon="code">
		All implementations are **tested on online judges**. Copy, paste, and it works. No pseudocode that you later don't know how to implement.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Real problems" icon="trophy">
		Each algorithm comes with **problems from Codeforces, AtCoder, and other platforms**. You know exactly where and how to apply what you learn.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Direct explanations" icon="chat">
		No unnecessary complications. I explain **what the algorithm does, why it works, and when to use it**. Period.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Start wherever works for you

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Never competed before" icon="add-document">
		Start with [Introduction](/en/introduction/) where I explain how to set everything up and the basic concepts you need to know.
	</Card>
	
	<Card title="Looking for something specific" icon="magnifier">
		Use the search or browse by categories. Each section is independent, you can jump wherever you need.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## What you'll find in each topic

- **Clear explanation** of the problem the algorithm solves
- **Complete implementation** in C++ ready to use
- **Complexity analysis** without mathematical complications
- **Practice problems** sorted by difficulty
- **Tips and tricks** from experienced competitors

The idea is simple: get you from knowing nothing to solving real problems as fast as possible.
